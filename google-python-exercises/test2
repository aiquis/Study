Dear Rioters,
I felt very excited when I saw that BI Analyst job in Riot and I really think I fit perfectly in this role at the company.
I’ve been working in the business intelligence area for the last 4 years, I've been part of projects in different size companies of a variety of industries. I am passionate with the data world and how we can use it to solve problems, generate insights and gain a depth understand of customers and users behaviors.  I’m also a very analytical person with good skills and knowledge in data visualization, which means that I can make deep analysis on data and communicate the information obtained in a simple and efficient way. Having worked as a consultant helped me to develop my ability enough to understand the various business needs, regardless of the area, so I can quickly help in developing the necessary BI solutions.
By now, I’m working in a sports channel called Esporte Interativo (Turner Broadcasting) in the digital products area. For 1 year I’ve worked on the BI team, I've been responsible for collecting, analyzing and generating reports with data from our main product, EI Plus, and also to another areas of our digital sector, like social media. I've helped the digital team to implement a data driven culture that didn’t exist in the company in the past. In the last 3 months I've started to work as a product owner with our remote development team, but I'm still helping the BI area, mainly with SQL stuff.
Besides my BI skills, I’m also a huge e-sports fan and I have worked in the area for several years. I've worked at TeamPlay Electronic Sports, the biggest e-sports site in Brazil, for 3 years. I covered daily news and events of e-sports and video games in general, I have produced podcasts and followed the news of the area. At Esporte Interativo I've been using the knowledge gained during my years working in this world to advise the company directors and content creators during the development of the company’s e-sports strategy.
I hope this cover letter finds you well. It’s the first one I write, since it’s not common in Brazil.
Best regards
